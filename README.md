# ashes-lfg-bot

How to use:
/lfg <follow the prompts>
This can be executed from any text channel.
If an existing group has an open slot for your role, you'll be pinged in a channel immediately to join.
If not, you'll go into a queue.
The queue is first come first serve.
When a slot in an existing group opens up for you, you have 5 mins to join the channel, otherwise you are out of the queue and out of luck.

/lfm open <follow the prompts>
This can only be executed from a voice channel's text channel.
A group is associated with the voice channel /lfm is run from.
NOTE: If that voice channel is left abandoned for over 5 mins, the bot will CLOSE the channel.
